# Themes

All templates in the system located in special modules - themes. A theme is a set of simple [PHPTheme](http://getphptheme.com) widgets that receive a set of parameters at the input and return a HTML code at the output. This allows you to completely separate the work on the functionality of the design settings and quickly change one design to another.

PHPTheme is a library for PHP that allows you to completely separate the HTML design code from the application code. The library continues the idea of template engines, and provides basic functions to divide the site theme into a set of simple widgets. Widgets receive prepared parameters and generate HTML code.

PHPTheme is designed to work with third-party products: frameworks, CMS, or even your personal script. The library for the implementation of its functions calls the adapter, written specifically for your platform, which works through the platform functions.
