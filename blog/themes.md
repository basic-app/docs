#Themes

All templates in the system located in special modules - themes. A theme is a set of simple [PHPTheme](http://getphptheme.com) widgets that receive a set of parameters at the input and return a HTML code at the output. This allows you to completely separate the work on the functionality of the design settings and quickly change one design to another.
